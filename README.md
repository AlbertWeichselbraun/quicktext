Quicktext is a Thunderbird extension, which has been created by Emil Hesslow. However, he was no longer able to update Quicktext or provide any kind of support. Thankfully he changed the license of Quicktext (and Quicktext Pro) to MPL 2.0 and shared its sources with the Thunderbird project, so others could update the extension to make it work with the most recent version of Thunderbird.

**Note:** Since Quicktext Pro has been released under MPL 2.0 as well, the Thunderbird Council decided to base the [official version of Quicktext](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/thunderbird/addon/quicktext/) on the "Pro" version. However, the name of the extension remains just "Quicktext". The obsolete "Standard" branch of Quicktext will not receive any further updates.

More information and usage descriptions can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/thundernest/quicktext/wiki) of this repository.
