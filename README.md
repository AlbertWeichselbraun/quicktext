Quicktext is a Thunderbird extension, which has been created by Emil Hesslow. However, he was no longer able to update Quicktext or provide any kind of support. Thankfully he changed the license of Quicktext (and Quicktext Pro) to MPL 2.0 and shared its sources with the Thunderbird project, so others could update the extension to make it work with the most recent version of Thunderbird.

Since Quicktext Pro is now released unter MPL 2.0 as well, the Thunderbird Council decided to base the [official version of Quicktext](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/thunderbird/addon/quicktext/) on the "pro" branch. However, the name of the extension remains just "Quicktext". The first official version including the pro features is 0.9.14. 

The "standard" branch of Quicktext will not receive any further updates.
